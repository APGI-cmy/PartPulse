## Notes
This repository was initialized via retroactive layer-down from an already-established governed repository. The repository was in "ALIGNED" state prior to this layer-down:
- Architecture phase completed (11 architecture documents)
- QA plan established (37 tests defined)
- Build phase in progress (Build-to-Green execution)
- 9 agent contracts active
- Governance version 2.0.0 synchronized

The `.architecture/` directory was created during this layer-down to complete mandatory structure requirements from REPOSITORY_INITIALIZATION_AND_GOVERNANCE_SEEDING_PROTOCOL.md.

The `qa/` directory exists in the repository root as an alternative to `.qa/` and serves the same purpose for QA evidence and artifacts.
