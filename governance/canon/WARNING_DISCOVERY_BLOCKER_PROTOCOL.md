## Purpose

This protocol defines the **mandatory blocker process** when any agent discovers warnings or test debt from prior work (previous jobs, waves, or subwaves).

**Core Principle**: **Any agent that discovers warning or test debt due to prior work MUST immediately generate a report, and the original agent must be re-assigned and required to perform the correction as a blocker, before downstream work proceeds.**

This protocol ensures that the doctrine of **"Zero warnings and zero test debt – all must be immediately remedied before downstream work proceeds"** is explicit, aligned, and non-optional across the entire governance framework.

## Summary

This is one of 15 critical Tier-0 governance canon files that establishes mandatory blocking and remediation for warnings.

Key components:
- **Discovery obligations**: Immediate halt, report generation, escalation
- **FM/Governance response**: Acknowledgment, responsible agent identification, re-assignment
- **Original agent remediation**: Fix root cause, provide remediation report, evidence
- **Discovering agent verification**: Re-validate, confirm resolution before resuming work
- **Forward-scan requirement**: Scan all pending work for same warning pattern
- **Warning classification**: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with different priorities
- **Whitelisting governance**: When allowed, requirements, expiration
- **Absolute prohibitions**: Both for discovering agents and for FM/governance
