# MANDATORY ENHANCEMENT & IMPROVEMENT CAPTURE STANDARD

## Status
**Type**: Canonical Governance Standard  
**Authority**: Supreme - Johan Ras  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Effective Date**: 2026-01-08  
**Applies To**: All Agents, Builders, and Applications  
**Enforcement**: Mandatory for all work units

---

## 1. Purpose

To institutionalize continuous improvement across all applications, agents, and builders **without disrupting execution or introducing scope creep**.

This standard ensures that learning, observations, and improvement ideas are systematically captured, parked, and preserved for future consideration, while maintaining strict execution discipline.

**Critical Extension (v2.0.0)**: This standard now explicitly requires **process improvement reflection** in addition to feature enhancements. Builders must reflect on **what failed in the build process** and **what governance, tooling, or process gaps were exposed**, ensuring systematic capture of execution learnings beyond product features.

---

## 2. Mandatory Requirement

At the conclusion of **any completed work unit**, every agent or builder MUST explicitly perform **BOTH**:

1. **Feature Enhancement Review** — Product features, architectural improvements, or technical optimizations
2. **Process Improvement Reflection** — Build process, governance compliance, tooling gaps, workflow issues, or systematic failures

---

## 3. Process Improvement Reflection (NEW - v2.0.0)

Every builder MUST answer the following questions at the conclusion of each work unit:

1. **What went well in this build?**
2. **What was blocked, failed, or caused delays?**
3. **What governance or process gaps were exposed?**
4. **What should be improved before the next iteration?**
5. **Did the builder comply with all applicable governance learnings?**

---

## Summary

This is one of 15 critical Tier-0 governance canon files that ensures continuous systematic improvement.

Key requirements:
- **Mandatory dual reflection**: Feature enhancements AND process improvements
- **Mandatory reflection questions**: All 5 questions must be answered explicitly
- **No silence allowed**: Either submit proposals OR declare none (after reflection)
- **Parking station segregation**: Feature enhancements vs. process improvements tracked separately
- **No proactive execution**: All enhancements parked, not executed, without authorization
- **Bootstrap learning promotion**: Process gaps escalate to BL entries and governance evolution

**Version**: 2.0.0
