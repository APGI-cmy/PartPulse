## Authority

CS2 (Johan Ras in bootstrap mode, Maturion in production) retains **supreme authority** for ALL agent contract files. However, to enable governance alignment automation and operational ripple, a **granular delegation hierarchy** is established below CS2 with explicit boundaries.

## Summary

This is one of 15 critical Tier-0 governance canon files that establish the granular authority model for agent contract modification across the Maturion ecosystem.

The model includes:
- **5-level authority hierarchy**: CS2 → governance-repo-administrator → governance-liaison → FM → Builders
- **Authority boundaries** ("Zebras") that protect ecosystem oversight
- **Self-modification prohibition** that is absolute
- **Change request process** for authorized agents
- **Escalation requirements** for all modifications

**Version**: 2.0.0
