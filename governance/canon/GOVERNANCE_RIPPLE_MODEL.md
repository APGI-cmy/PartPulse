## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Governance Ripple Model** - a bidirectional governance evolution framework that enables governance to adapt and improve while maintaining authority, consistency, and auditability.

The Governance Ripple Model ensures:
- Governance changes propagate **downward** to all governed repositories
- Lessons learned propagate **upward** from repositories to governance
- Governance evolves without weakening enforcement
- Governance remains non-blocking while maintaining rigor
- All evolution is tracked, versioned, and auditable

This model prevents governance stagnation while preserving constitutional authority.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Bidirectional Evolution

Governance must support evolution in **both directions**:

**Downward**: Governance → Repositories
- New governance rules propagate to all governed repos
- Schema updates propagate to all consumers
- Policy changes propagate to all enforcers
- Gate requirements propagate to all builders

**Upward**: Repositories → Governance
- Failure patterns promote to governance
- Lessons learned promote to governance
- Enforcement insights promote to governance
- Practical constraints promote to governance

Both directions are **mandatory and continuous**.

### 2.2 Evolution Without Weakening

Governance evolution must:
- ✅ Improve clarity and enforceability
- ✅ Add missing rules discovered through practice
- ✅ Remove ambiguity and conflicts
- ✅ Adapt to new contexts and requirements

Governance evolution must NOT:
- ❌ Weaken existing enforcement
- ❌ Create loopholes
- ❌ Reduce auditability
- ❌ Compromise constitutional principles

**Governance evolves to become stronger, never weaker.**

## Summary

This is one of 15 critical Tier-0 governance canon files that establishes how governance evolves continuously.

Key elements:
- **Downward ripple**: Governance changes → repositories (versioned, propagated, validated)
- **Upward ripple**: Repository learnings → governance (promoted, versioned, integrated)
- **Evolution without weakening**: Stricter enforcement, never looser
- **Non-blocking evolution**: Versioned, transitioned, auditable
- **Ripple tracking**: Central inventory, consumer alignment
- **Bidirectional flow**: Learning drives governance which drives practice

**Version**: v1.0  
**Authority**: Canonical Governance Policy (Tier-0)
