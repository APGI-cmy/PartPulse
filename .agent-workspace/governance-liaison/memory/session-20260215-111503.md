## Agent

## Context
- Branch: copilot/fix-drift-detected-issue
- Commit: 0360d22

## Task
Resolve scheduled governance alignment drift detected by automated check (scheduled-20260215-082747).

**Issue**: Drift Detected - sync_state.json not initialized  
**Authority**: CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md § 2, § 8

Recent commits:
```
0360d22 governance: baseline establishment - align sync_state.json
ae382d0 governance: initial alignment plan for drift resolution
fe82ea7 Initial plan
```

## Actions Taken
- Executed wake-up protocol and identified drift in sync_state.json
- Cloned canonical governance repository and examined target commit a4e4513
- Determined operation as baseline establishment (no new files to layer down)
- Executed 7-step layer-down protocol
- Created comprehensive evidence bundle in `.agent-admin/governance/layer-down/baseline-establishment-20260215/`
- Updated sync_state.json: alignment_status "aligned", drift_detected false
- Updated ripple-log.md with baseline establishment entry
- Committed changes and executed session closure

## Decisions Made
- **Baseline Establishment**: Determined this was a baseline establishment operation, not standard layer-down. Commit a4e4513 contains only internal governance repository admin changes (auto-ripple investigation), no PUBLIC_API canon changes requiring layer-down.
- **State Tracking Fix**: Resolved by updating sync_state.json to reflect actual alignment state. PartPulse already had 69+ canonical governance artifacts properly synced (last documented sync: 2026-02-11).
- **Evidence Structure**: Created complete evidence bundle per GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_CHECKLIST_PROTOCOL.md (manifest, SHA256 verification, log, assessment, proof).

## Evidence Collection
- Prehandover proof: `.agent-admin/governance/layer-down/baseline-establishment-20260215/completion-proof.md`
- Layer-down evidence: 5 artifacts in baseline-establishment-20260215/ directory
- Ripple log: Updated `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison/ripple-log.md`
- sync_state.json: Updated to reflect aligned state

## Outcome
**SUCCESS** - Baseline establishment complete. sync_state.json initialized, drift resolved, comprehensive evidence documented. Future scheduled checks will correctly report "aligned" status.

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Systematic root cause analysis identified the issue quickly (state tracking vs. missing files)
- 7-step layer-down protocol provided clear structure for baseline establishment
- Evidence documentation comprehensive and well-organized

### What Was Challenging
- Initial confusion between "drift detected" and "files missing" - required careful analysis to understand root cause
- Distinguishing between true drift (missing files) and state tracking drift (uninitialized sync_state)

### Future Sessions Should Know
- sync_state.json must be initialized immediately after any layer-down operation
- Drift detection can report false positives when state tracking not properly initialized
- Baseline establishment is a valid operation type when sync_state needs initialization
- Always cross-reference GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md to verify actual governance file presence
