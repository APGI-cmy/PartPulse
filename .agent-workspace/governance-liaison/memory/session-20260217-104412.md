2abc6b5 governance: Create FOREMAN agent contract requirements checklist
b91c569 Initial plan
06f11c2 Merge pull request #359 from APGI-cmy/copilot/align-codexadvisor-contract
```


## Actions Taken
- Executed wake-up protocol (environment health validated, governance loaded)
- Analyzed reference materials (Foreman contract v4.5.0, Governance Liaison checklist template)
- Created comprehensive Foreman checklist with 51 requirements across 10 categories
- Validated character count (23,556 < 30K limit for GitHub Copilot UI)
- Mapped Foreman-specific requirements to canonical protocols
- Created PREHANDOVER proof with execution steps and compliance attestation
- Committed changes and requested code review (no issues found)
- Executed session closure protocol

## Decisions Made
- **Category structure**: Used Governance Liaison checklist as template for consistency across agent role checklists
- **Foreman-specific requirements**: Included unique FM elements (builder recruitment, wave orchestration, merge gate ownership, zero test debt enforcement, STOP-AND-FIX, supervision-only pattern)
- **Character limit compliance**: Ensured checklist under 30K characters (23,556) for GitHub Copilot UI selectability
- **Canonical references**: Sourced all requirements from Foreman contract bindings and Living Agent System v6.2.0 architecture

## Evidence Collection
- Prehandover proof: `.agent-admin/prehandover/FOREMAN_CHECKLIST_CREATION_PROOF.md`
- Gate results: Code review completed (no issues)
- Continuous improvements: Session memory capture, reference-based protection model usage

## Outcome
**Success** - FOREMAN agent contract requirements checklist created and delivered with full compliance attestation.

**Deliverable**: `governance/checklists/FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` (23,556 characters, 51 requirements, 10 categories + role-specific boundaries)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Template reuse from Governance Liaison checklist provided consistent structure
- Reference-based mapping to canonical protocols ensured completeness
- Character count validation prevented exceeding 30K limit
- Foreman contract bindings provided comprehensive canonical reference list

### What Was Challenging
- Mapping supervision-only pattern requirements (FM does not implement, only supervises)
- Distinguishing FM role-specific boundaries from general agent requirements
- Ensuring all Foreman-unique elements captured (platform prohibition, builder recruitment, wave orchestration)

### Future Sessions Should Know
- Foreman checklist now available as reference for future FM contract validation
- Living Agent System v6.2.0 architecture requires all 10 categories + role-specific boundaries
- Character count limit (30K) is critical for GitHub Copilot UI selectability
- Reference-based protection model allows condensed contracts while maintaining full governance compliance
