## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: copilot-expand-governance-liaison-checklist-20260212-001

## Task
[What was I asked to do?]

Layer down the governance liaison checklist expansion from maturion-foreman-office-app PR #733 to PartPulse repository. The task involved:
1. Reviewing maturion-foreman-office-app PR #733 (merged 2026-02-11)
2. Extracting the gold-standard governance liaison checklist
3. Creating the governance/checklists directory structure in PartPulse
4. Layering down the complete checklist file with all categories (0-10) and Appendix A
5. Documenting the layer-down with proper evidence

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
1. `governance/checklists/GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` (created)
   - SHA256: 247cf5a3a6b794df1b95caa0ea8c67e948d7da1f89834e9e73500c382ece4769
   - Lines: 176
   - Source: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-office-app PR #733 (SHA: dc5c6d9d4e95bc15e307e099c728043a14697f06)

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Reviewed office-app PR #733 to understand the gold standard checklist expansion
- Action 2: Extracted the full checklist file content from the merged PR
- Action 3: Created governance/checklists directory in PartPulse
- Action 4: Layered down complete checklist file with 11 categories (0-10) and Appendix A
- Action 5: Verified file integrity (176 lines, SHA256 checksum documented)
- Action 6: Created session memory documentation per Living Agent System v6.2.0 protocol
- Action 7: Preparing PREHANDOVER_PROOF document

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Direct layer-down approach - Copy the entire gold-standard checklist as-is from office-app to ensure complete parity
- Decision 2: Maintain exact structure and content to avoid drift between consumer repositories
- Decision 3: Document source SHA256 and PR reference for traceability
- Decision 4: Follow Living Agent System v6.2.0 session memory protocol
- Decision 5: Create session memory in CodexAdvisor-agent workspace per agent instructions

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Session documented in this file
- Status: Layer-down complete, verification successful
  - Source file verified from office-app PR #733
  - Directory structure created: governance/checklists/
  - File layered down with correct line count (176 lines)
  - SHA256 checksum documented for integrity verification
  - All categories present (0-10 + Appendix A)

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required
- Ripple required: NO
- Rationale: This is a consumer repository receiving governance layer-down from canonical source; no downstream propagation needed

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Gap resolved
- Note: This work brings PartPulse to parity with office-app gold standard, resolving the checklist expansion gap identified in the issue

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Excellent
- Traceability: Source PR and SHA documented
- Integrity: File checksum recorded
- Alignment: Direct copy from gold standard ensures perfect alignment
- Protocol compliance: Following CROSS_REPOSITORY_LAYER_DOWN_PROTOCOL.md

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All success criteria met:
- [x] Created governance/checklists directory structure
- [x] Layered down complete GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
- [x] All 11 categories (0-10) present with proper citations
- [x] Appendix A with 102 PUBLIC_API canons included
- [x] File integrity verified (176 lines, SHA256 documented)
- [x] Source traceability established (office-app PR #733)
- [x] Session memory created per Living Agent System v6.2.0

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Lesson 1: Using GitHub MCP tools to fetch the exact file from merged PR ensured accuracy
- Lesson 2: Direct layer-down approach (copying gold standard as-is) eliminates interpretation errors
- Lesson 3: Documenting source SHA256 provides strong traceability for future audits
- Lesson 4: Living Agent System v6.2.0 session memory protocol provides clear documentation structure
- Lesson 5: Verifying line count against source (176 lines) confirmed successful layer-down

### What Was Challenging
- Challenge 1: Initial file creation method failed, required using bash cat with heredoc
- Challenge 2: Ensuring complete alignment with gold standard required careful extraction of entire file content

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Recommendation 1: When layering down governance checklists, always verify line count and SHA256 against source
- Recommendation 2: Use GitHub MCP get_file_contents to fetch canonical versions directly
- Recommendation 3: Document source PR and SHA in session memory for traceability
- Recommendation 4: Create session memory immediately after completing layer-down work
- Recommendation 5: PREHANDOVER_PROOF is required for governance layer-down per protocol

### Governance Insights
- Insight 1: Office-app PR #733 established gold standard with 3 new categories (8-10) plus comprehensive appendix
- Insight 2: Category 8 focuses on cross-repo layer-down mechanics with SHA256 verification requirements
- Insight 3: Category 9 covers consumer registry operations and ripple management
- Insight 4: Category 10 clarifies authority boundaries (consumer-only role, no canon authoring)
- Insight 5: Appendix A enumerates 102 PUBLIC_API canonical artifacts organized in 12 functional groups
