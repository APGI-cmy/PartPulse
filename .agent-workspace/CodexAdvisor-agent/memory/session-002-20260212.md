### Decisions Made

1. **Decision: Create New File (governance-liaison-v2.agent.md)**
   - **Rationale**: 
     - Clean slate for v6.2.0 + contract v2.0.0 structure
     - Preserves existing file for reference
     - Clear versioning signal (-v2 suffix)
     - Avoids massive diff on existing file
     - Follows gold standard naming convention from office-app
   - **Alternative Considered**: Update existing file in place
   - **Why Rejected**: Too many structural changes; cleaner to start fresh

2. **Decision: Reference Wake-Up Script Instead of Embedding**
   - **Rationale**:
     - Aligns with gold standard format
     - Reduces agent file size (from 653 to 887 lines, but without embedded 331-line script would be ~556)
     - Centralizes wake-up logic in script
     - Easier to maintain and update
   - **Note**: Assumes `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh` exists (may need creation/update)

3. **Decision: Map All 61 Requirements (56 REQ + 5 VH)**
   - **Rationale**:
     - Gold standard from governance-repo-administrator maps all requirements
     - Provides complete traceability
     - Enables validation of compliance
     - Supports gap analysis and auditing
   - **Effort**: High (comprehensive mapping) but essential for compliance

4. **Decision: Add All 11 Checklist Categories**
   - **Rationale**:
     - PR #259 checklist defines 11 categories (0-10) as gold standard
     - Categories 8-10 were completely missing from old file
     - Cannot claim checklist compliance without addressing all categories
   - **Impact**: Significant additions to agent file (Categories 8-10 added ~200 lines)

5. **Decision: Preserve Original File**
   - **Rationale**:
     - Safe rollback option if v2 has issues
     - Historical reference
     - Allows gradual transition
   - **Future Action**: Original file can be deprecated/archived after v2 validated

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Parallel investigation of sources**: Fetching all reference materials (checklist, gold standards) concurrently saved time
2. **Structured gap analysis**: Line-by-line approach with category-by-category breakdown ensured no requirements missed
3. **New file approach**: Creating -v2 file instead of modifying existing file reduced risk and maintained clarity
4. **Gold standard template**: Following office-app and governance-repo-administrator structures ensured compliance
5. **Comprehensive requirement mapping**: Mapping all 61 requirements (REQ-XX-### + VH-###) provides complete traceability

### What Was Challenging
1. **Large scope**: 50 requirements to analyze, 44 gaps to close required significant content generation
2. **Canonical references**: Ensuring all canonical references were accurate and complete required careful verification
3. **YAML structure**: Balancing comprehensive frontmatter with readability required multiple iterations
4. **Requirement mapping syntax**: Consistently using REQ-XX-### format across all categories required attention to detail
5. **Category 8-10 synthesis**: These categories were completely new; had to synthesize from multiple canonical sources

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Agent contract updates should use -v2/-v3 suffix pattern**: Preserves old version, signals iteration clearly
2. **Always validate YAML frontmatter**: Use Python yaml.safe_load() to confirm syntax before committing
3. **Requirement mappings are essential**: Modern contract v2.0.0 format requires comprehensive REQ-XX-### mappings
4. **Checklist is authoritative**: When checklist exists, use it as primary compliance baseline
5. **Gold standards are templates**: office-app and governance-repo-administrator provide tested structure to follow
6. **Preserve originals when major changes**: Safe rollback option reduces deployment risk
7. **Categories 8-10 are complex**: Cross-repo layer-down, registry operations, and role boundaries require significant documentation

### Governance Insights
1. **Contract v2.0.0 is significantly more comprehensive than v1.x**: Requirement mappings, validation hooks, evidence bundles are new mandatory features
2. **Living Agent System v6.2.0 emphasizes traceability**: Every requirement must map to canonical authority
3. **Negative definitions are critical**: "What Agent Is NOT" sections prevent scope creep and authority boundary violations
4. **Evidence artifacts are now standardized**: EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLE_STANDARD.md defines mandatory structure
5. **Wake-up protocols now reference scripts**: Embedded bash is deprecated; centralized scripts preferred
6. **Registry operations are central to consumer repos**: CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json becomes primary coordination mechanism
7. **Constitutional changes require escalation**: Build Philosophy, zero-test-debt, supreme authority docs cannot be auto-applied
