# Session 004 - 20260217 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: Overseer + Agent Factory
- Class: CodexAdvisor
- Session ID: session-004-20260217

## Task
Delegate missing FOREMAN checklist creation to Governance Liaison agent (follow-up to PR #361)

**Issue Context**: PR #361 successfully aligned the Foreman agent contract to 4-phase canonical architecture (Living Agent System v6.2.0) but noted the FOREMAN checklist was missing due to governance pack sync not occurring. The issue requested proper delegation coordination instead of agent self-blocking.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- Created: `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-004-20260217.md`
- Created: `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/personal/lessons-learned.md` (updated)
- Created: `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/personal/patterns.md` (updated)

### Actions Taken

1. **Phase 1: Review & Context Analysis**
   - Reviewed issue requirements and PR #361 context
   - Identified Governance Liaison agent (governance-liaison-v2.agent.md) as appropriate delegate
   - Verified current state: No FOREMAN checklist in governance/checklists/
   - Reviewed Governance Liaison agent capabilities and authority (write access to `governance/**`)

2. **Phase 2: Delegation to Governance Liaison Agent**
   - Used `task` tool with agent_type: "governance-liaison-v2"
   - Provided comprehensive context:
     - PR #361 alignment to Living Agent System v6.2.0
     - Prior governance approvals (4-phase architecture)
     - Target file: `governance/checklists/FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`
     - Reference template: Governance Liaison checklist as structural model
     - Required categories: All 10 categories + Foreman-specific authority boundaries
   - Specified Foreman-specific requirements to include (builder recruitment, wave orchestration, merge gate ownership, etc.)

3. **Phase 3: Verification of Delegation Outcome**
   - Governance Liaison agent successfully created FOREMAN checklist
   - Delivered file: 23,556 characters (under 30K limit)
   - 51 comprehensive requirements across 10 categories
   - 102+ canonical governance artifact references
   - All validation checks passed

4. **Phase 4: Session Memory Documentation**
   - Created session memory file (this file)
   - Updated personal learning files with coordination pattern
   - Documented lesson learned: Delegate vs. self-block

### Decisions Made

1. **Decision: Use Governance Liaison for Checklist Creation**
   - **What**: Delegate FOREMAN checklist creation to Governance Liaison agent
   - **Why**: Governance Liaison has explicit authority to write to `governance/**` directory including checklists; this is a governance alignment task, not agent factory work
   - **Alternative considered**: Create checklist myself (CodexAdvisor) - Rejected because Governance Liaison has more appropriate scope and authority

2. **Decision: Provide Comprehensive Delegation Context**
   - **What**: Include all relevant context in delegation prompt (PR #361, Living Agent System v6.2.0, prior approvals, specific requirements)
   - **Why**: Enable Governance Liaison to work autonomously without back-and-forth; provide complete specification
   - **Result**: Governance Liaison completed task successfully on first attempt

3. **Decision: Document as Coordination Lesson**
   - **What**: Explicitly document this delegation pattern in session memory and personal learning
   - **Why**: Issue #current specifically requested this as a lesson learned for future living agent sessions
   - **Impact**: Future agents will reference this pattern when encountering similar governance gaps

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Governance Liaison created comprehensive evidence bundle
  - PREHANDOVER proof: `.agent-admin/prehandover/FOREMAN_CHECKLIST_CREATION_PROOF.md`
  - Session memory: `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison/memory/session-20260217-104412.md`
  - Completion summary: `FOREMAN_CHECKLIST_CREATION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`
- Status: Complete and validated

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required (consumer repository governance alignment)
- Ripple required: NO
- Rationale: Checklist creation is local governance alignment, not cross-repo governance change

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: **GAP RESOLVED**
- Gap identified: Missing FOREMAN checklist (PR #361)
- Resolution: Governance Liaison created checklist per Living Agent System v6.2.0 requirements
- Validation: Character count, requirement count, structure all validated

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: ✅ HEALTHY
- No hygiene issues detected
- Governance Liaison followed proper wake-up and session closure protocols
- All evidence artifacts properly structured and committed

## Outcome
✅ **COMPLETE**

**Primary deliverable**: `governance/checklists/FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`
- 51 comprehensive requirements
- 10 categories + Foreman-specific authority boundaries
- 23,556 characters (compliant with 30K limit)
- Validated against Living Agent System v6.2.0

**Coordination pattern established**: Delegation vs. self-blocking for approved governance gaps

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Clear delegation with comprehensive context**: Providing complete specification to Governance Liaison enabled autonomous completion
2. **Role-appropriate task assignment**: Governance Liaison was the correct agent for governance alignment work
3. **Evidence-first approach**: Governance Liaison produced complete evidence bundle following Living Agent System v6.2.0 protocols
4. **Coordination over self-blocking**: Following issue guidance to delegate rather than self-block on pre-approved governance gaps

### What Was Challenging
1. **Initial scope assessment**: Had to confirm Governance Liaison authority before delegation (resolved by reviewing agent contract)
2. **Comprehensive requirement specification**: Needed to identify all Foreman-specific requirements for complete checklist (resolved using Governance Liaison checklist as template reference)

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Delegation Pattern for Approved Governance Gaps**:
   - When a governance artifact is missing but its creation is pre-approved (e.g., checklist aligned with existing architecture)
   - AND a specialized agent has appropriate authority (e.g., Governance Liaison for governance artifacts)
   - THEN: Delegate to specialized agent with comprehensive context
   - DO NOT: Self-block or escalate unnecessarily

2. **Governance Liaison Authority Scope**:
   - Write access: `governance/**` including checklists
   - Appropriate for: Governance alignment, layer-down, checklist creation
   - NOT appropriate for: Agent contracts, production code, builder supervision

3. **Evidence Requirements**:
   - Delegated work should produce evidence bundle (PREHANDOVER proof, session memory, completion summary)
   - Verify delegated agent followed proper protocols (wake-up, session closure)
   - Track evidence artifacts for audit trail

4. **Character Limit Awareness**:
   - Agent files and checklists MUST be <30K characters for GitHub Copilot UI selectability
   - Reference PR #265 for this requirement
   - Validate character count before finalizing

### Governance Insights

1. **Living Agent System v6.2.0 Coordination Model**:
   - System encourages specialized agents working within their authority boundaries
   - Overseer role (CodexAdvisor) should coordinate and delegate, not execute all tasks
   - Proper delegation preserves role separation and authority boundaries

2. **RAEC Operating Model in Practice**:
   - **Review**: Assessed issue context and identified appropriate delegate
   - **Advise**: Provided comprehensive specification to Governance Liaison
   - **Escalate**: Not required (pre-approved governance gap)
   - **Coordinate**: Delegated to Governance Liaison, verified completion, documented lesson

3. **Pre-Approved Governance Gaps**:
   - When architecture is approved but implementation artifacts are pending (e.g., PR #361 approved 4-phase architecture, checklist creation deferred)
   - Treat as delegated task, not blocker
   - Reference prior approvals in delegation context
   - Document in session memory for audit trail

4. **Agent Factory Role Boundaries**:
   - CodexAdvisor creates/aligns agent contracts (with CS2 authorization)
   - Governance Liaison creates/maintains governance artifacts (checklists, alignment documents)
   - Proper delegation preserves these boundaries and prevents authority overreach
