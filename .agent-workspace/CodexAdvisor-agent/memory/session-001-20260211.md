## Task
Align Foreman and Governance Liaison checklists to office-app gold standard, incorporating lessons learned from PRs #730 and #733.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
1. `.github/agents/PartPulse-app_FM.md` - v4.3.0 → v4.4.0
   - SHA256: (to be calculated after final commit)
   
2. `CHECKLIST_ALIGNMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Created (1,175 lines)
   - SHA256: (to be calculated after final commit)
   
3. `CHECKLIST_ALIGNMENT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` - Created
   - SHA256: (to be calculated after final commit)
   
4. `README_CHECKLIST_ALIGNMENT.md` - Created
   - SHA256: (to be calculated after final commit)

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Comprehensive analysis of governance-liaison and Foreman contracts against office-app gold standard
- Action 2: Created three-tier documentation (README, Executive Summary, Full Recommendations)
- Action 3: Implemented Phase 1 (Critical) enhancements to Foreman contract:
  - Wake-Up Protocol (AGENT_BASELINE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md)
  - PR Failure Analysis Protocol (LOCKED) - office-app incident lessons
  - Pre-Merge Gate Simulation checklist
- Action 4: Updated Foreman contract version to v4.4.0 with version history
- Action 5: Tested wake-up protocol successfully

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Governance Liaison requires NO changes (already includes PR Failure Analysis Protocol from 2026-02-09 governance ripple)
- Decision 2: Foreman contract needs 8 enhancements across 3 phases (prioritized by criticality)
- Decision 3: Implemented Phase 1 immediately (3 critical protocols), leaving Phase 2/3 for future work
- Decision 4: One protocol (PR Failure Analysis) is LOCKED and requires CS2 approval
- Decision 5: All recommendations implement existing bindings (no new governance requirements)

## Living Agent System v5.0.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Analysis documents created (README, Executive Summary, Full Recommendations)
- Status: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2/3 documented for future implementation

### Ripple Status
- Status: Received and processed office-app governance ripple lessons (PRs #730, #733)
- Ripple required: NO (consumer repository - received ripple from canonical source)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Analyzed 8 gaps in Foreman contract, closed 3 (Phase 1), documented 5 remaining
- Gap documentation: CHECKLIST_ALIGNMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md Part 3

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: All changes align with existing bindings, no new governance requirements introduced
- LOCKED section added with proper metadata (CS2 approval required)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE (Phase 1 of 3)

**Governance Aligned**:
- Governance Liaison: Already aligned (no action needed)
- Foreman Contract: Phase 1 complete (Wake-Up, PR Failure, Gate Simulation)
- Version: v4.4.0 (from v4.3.0)
- Remaining: Phase 2 (3 protocols) and Phase 3 (2 protocols) documented for future implementation

**Evidence Created**:
- README_CHECKLIST_ALIGNMENT.md (navigation guide)
- CHECKLIST_ALIGNMENT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (CS2 decision summary)
- CHECKLIST_ALIGNMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md (1,175-line detailed analysis)
- Updated Foreman contract with 3 new protocol sections

**Success Criteria Met** (Phase 1):
- [x] Governance Liaison has PR failure protocol (already present)
- [x] FM has Wake-Up Protocol
- [x] FM has PR Failure Analysis Protocol (LOCKED)
- [x] FM has Pre-Merge Gate Simulation checklist
- [ ] Phase 2 enhancements (deferred, documented)
- [ ] Phase 3 enhancements (deferred, documented)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Comprehensive three-tier documentation approach (README → Executive → Detailed)
- Phased implementation strategy (3 phases based on criticality)
- Delegating detailed analysis to sub-agent (CodexAdvisor) for specialized governance work
- Testing wake-up protocol immediately after implementation
- All recommendations grounded in existing bindings (no new governance requirements)

### What Was Challenging
- Office-app PRs #730/#733 are in a different repository (not directly accessible)
- Had to infer gold standard from existing governance ripple documentation
- Large FM contract file (38.8 KB → 1,300+ lines) required careful insertion placement
- Balancing comprehensiveness with minimal changes (only Phase 1 implemented)

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Governance Liaison already has gold standard PR Failure Analysis Protocol (2026-02-09)
- Foreman contract Phase 2/3 enhancements are fully documented in CHECKLIST_ALIGNMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md
- Wake-up protocol tested and verified working
- LOCKED section (PR Failure Analysis) requires CS2 approval before effective
- All 8 recommendations implement existing FM bindings (no new requirements)

### Governance Insights
- Office-app incident (PRs #730/#733) established gold standard for PR failure handling
- Governance ripple successfully propagated PR failure protocol to governance-liaison (2026-02-09)
- Foreman needed same protocols extended from governance-liaison
- Phased approach enables incremental approval and validation
- Living Agent System v5.0.0 memory protocols followed correctly
