# Session 003 - 20260212 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: codexadvisor-20260212-144300

## Task
**CS2 Authorization**: Full self-audit of CodexAdvisor agent (Issue #1070+)

Tasks assigned:
1. Search for the CodexAdvisor checklist in `.governance-pack/checklists/CODEX_ADVISOR_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Confirm `.governance-pack/CANON_INVENTORY.json` is present & layered down
3. Ensure checklist covers compliance requirements (30K char limit, Living Agent System v6.2.0, message requirements)
4. Perform gap analysis: checklist vs inventory vs agent files
5. Verify version issue fix (v5.0.0 → v6.2.0 in session memory template)
6. Develop and enact corrective plan

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` - SHA256: 3ff3df3103bfc68c21e6b256d7143b06d1a496ceb66b4793c3dc053e7d89cc88
- `.github/agents/governance-liaison.md` - SHA256: 4860b64237a6e42c0ba3024eb45f9213de4d6717642d60f7b9a5e7749ae95dd1
- `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/escalation-inbox/blocker-20260212.md` - Created
- `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-003-20260212.md` - Created

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Verified repository structure and governance pack location
- Action 2: Searched for `.governance-pack/` directory → **NOT FOUND**
- Action 3: Searched for `CANON_INVENTORY.json` → **NOT FOUND**
- Action 4: Searched for CodexAdvisor checklist → **NOT FOUND**
- Action 5: Verified version bug in CodexAdvisor agent (v5.0.0 in session memory template)
- Action 6: Fixed version references v5.0.0 → v6.2.0 in CodexAdvisor-agent.md (3 locations)
- Action 7: Fixed version references v5.0.0 → v6.2.0 in governance-liaison.md (5 locations)
- Action 8: Verified Foreman agent already uses v6.2.0 (no changes needed)
- Action 9: Validated character counts (all agents < 30K limit)
- Action 10: Created escalation document for missing governance pack

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Fix version bug immediately (v5.0.0 → v6.2.0) - this was the verified issue from CS2
- Decision 2: Escalate missing `.governance-pack/` to CS2 rather than create it without authorization
- Decision 3: Document all findings in session memory and escalation for CS2 review
- Decision 4: Cannot complete full gap analysis without checklist and inventory files

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: This session memory file
- Status: Partial completion - blocked by missing governance artifacts

### Critical Findings
1. **VERIFIED BUG FIXED**: v5.0.0 → v6.2.0 in session memory templates
   - CodexAdvisor-agent.md: Lines 129, 151, 188 - **FIXED**
   - governance-liaison.md: Lines 8, 37, 43, 365, 652 - **FIXED**
   
2. **CRITICAL GAP**: `.governance-pack/` directory missing
   - Expected location: `.governance-pack/CANON_INVENTORY.json`
   - Expected checklists: `.governance-pack/checklists/*.md`
   - Status: **DOES NOT EXIST**

3. **INCONSISTENT REFERENCES**: 
   - CodexAdvisor references: `.governance-pack/CANON_INVENTORY.json`
   - Foreman references: `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json`
   - What exists: `governance/TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json` (v5.0.0)

4. **CHARACTER COUNT COMPLIANCE**:
   - CodexAdvisor-agent.md: 21,185 chars ✅ (< 30K)
   - governance-liaison.md: 21,168 chars ✅ (< 30K)
   - PartPulse-app_FM.md: 13,936 chars ✅ (< 30K)

### Ripple Status
- Status: N/A - governance pack layer-down required first
- Ripple required: YES - for governance pack artifacts

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Version bug fixed, but governance pack gap remains
- Gap documented in escalation: `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/escalation-inbox/blocker-20260212.md`

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Detected inconsistent governance artifact locations
- Issue: Multiple references to non-existent `.governance-pack/CANON_INVENTORY.json`
- Issue: TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json shows v5.0.0 (should be v6.2.0)

## Outcome
⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Version bug fixed, but cannot complete full audit without governance pack

### Completed
- ✅ Version bug fixed (v5.0.0 → v6.2.0 in session memory templates)
- ✅ Verified character count compliance (all agents < 30K)
- ✅ Created escalation for missing governance pack
- ✅ Documented all findings

### Blocked
- ❌ Cannot verify checklist compliance (checklist file missing)
- ❌ Cannot verify inventory alignment (CANON_INVENTORY.json missing)
- ❌ Cannot complete gap analysis (no checklist to compare against)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Systematic search approach identified all missing components
- Parallel file edits efficiently fixed version references
- Character count validation confirmed no file size issues
- Escalation properly documented authority boundaries

### What Was Challenging
- Cannot complete full audit without governance pack infrastructure
- Inconsistent governance artifact references across agent files
- Uncertainty about correct governance pack layer-down process

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Governance pack layer-down must occur before agent factory operations
- Version consistency is critical - check ALL version references
- Character count validation should be routine (30K hard limit)
- Always escalate when authority boundaries are reached

### Governance Insights
- Insight 1: Repository appears to be in transition state (v5.0.0 → v6.2.0)
- Insight 2: Agent contracts reference governance artifacts that don't exist locally
- Insight 3: Foreman agent uses different governance path than CodexAdvisor/liaison
- Insight 4: TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json shows v5.0.0, not v6.2.0
