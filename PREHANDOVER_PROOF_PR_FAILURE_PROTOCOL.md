## Protocol Enforcement Details

### Mandatory Triggers
The PR Failure Analysis Protocol MUST be executed when:
- Creating retry PR after ANY governance-liaison PR failure
- Recent closed/failed PRs visible in `gh pr list --state closed`

### STOP Directives (2 enforcement points)
1. **After Step 1**: Do NOT proceed until workflow logs READ and UNDERSTOOD
2. **After Step 3**: Do NOT create retry PR until local validation PASSES

### Escalation Requirements
- After 2 retry attempts with persistent failures
- Create detailed escalation in `governance/escalation/`
- Tag CS2 for assistance
- DO NOT continue retry loop

### Lock Status
- **Lock ID**: LOCK-LIAISON-PR-FAILURE-001
- **Modification Authority**: CS2 only
- **Review Frequency**: Quarterly
- **Status**: ACTIVE and ENFORCED

## Governance Context

### Authority Chain
```
Canonical Governance (APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance)
    ↓ Governance Ripple (this session)
PartPulse/.github/agents/governance-liaison.md
    ↓ Enforcement (starting after merge)
All future governance-liaison PRs
```

### Authorizing Documents
- **STOP_AND_FIX_DOCTRINE.md**: Universal Responsibility principle
- **CI_CONFIRMATORY_NOT_DIAGNOSTIC.md**: CI confirms, doesn't diagnose

### Trigger Event
- **Incident**: Catastrophic repeat PR failures in office-app repository
- **Root Cause**: Blind retry loops without failure analysis
- **Prevention**: Mandatory analysis before retry
