  "notes": "This is a baseline establishment operation. PartPulse already has governance files synced (last sync 2026-02-11T13:32:00Z per GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md). The drift detection was triggered because sync_state.json was not properly initialized. No new governance files need to be layered down. This operation establishes the baseline tracking state."
