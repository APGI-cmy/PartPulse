## 3. Change Impact Analysis

### 3.1 High Impact Agents

#### ForemanApp-agent (FM)
- **Current State**: Has 14 Tier-0 governance bindings
- **Change**: Add QIW canonical binding + QIW enforcement checklist
- **Impact**: FM must enforce QIW across all builders
- **Risk**: FM may need to coordinate QIW blocking with existing gate enforcement
- **Mitigation**: Clear QIW binding placement, explicit FM role in QIW escalation

#### governance-liaison
- **Current State**: Enforces governance compliance
- **Change**: Add QIW canonical binding + governance memory integration requirements
- **Impact**: GL must validate QIW compliance in agent work
- **Risk**: GL may need to interpret QIW blocking conditions
- **Mitigation**: Clear QIW binding with enforcement role specification

#### qa-builder
- **Current State**: Implements test suites, QA infrastructure
- **Change**: Add QIW canonical binding + QA blocking enforcement requirements
- **Impact**: QA Builder must ensure QIW channels are clean before handover
- **Risk**: QA Builder may encounter QIW blocks during test execution
- **Mitigation**: Clear QIW requirements in QA Builder's operational protocol

### 3.2 Medium Impact Agents

#### api-builder, ui-builder, schema-builder, integration-builder
- **Current State**: Specialized builders with domain-specific responsibilities
- **Change**: Add QIW canonical binding + channel-specific watchdog awareness
- **Impact**: Each builder must understand QIW observation for their domain
- **Risk**: Builders may not understand which QIW channels apply to their work
- **Mitigation**: Clear QIW binding + domain-specific channel mapping (build, lint for code builders)

### 3.3 Low Impact Agents

#### CodexAdvisor-agent
- **Current State**: Advisory agent for deep governance/architecture reasoning
- **Change**: Add QIW canonical binding for advisory consistency
- **Impact**: Codex must be aware of QIW for governance interpretation
- **Risk**: Minimal - advisory role doesn't directly interact with QIW
- **Mitigation**: QIW binding for completeness, no operational changes

### 3.4 Repository Contract (.agent)

- **Current State**: 27 governance bindings, 9 agents defined
- **Change**: Add QIW canonical binding to governance.bindings section
- **Impact**: Repository-wide governance reference for all agents
- **Risk**: Binding must be correctly positioned and formatted
- **Mitigation**: Follow existing binding structure, add after AUTOMATED_DEPRECATION_DETECTION_GATE

---

## 4. Ripple Effects

### 4.1 Cross-Agent Dependencies

**FM → Builders**:
- FM orchestrates builders; if QIW added to FM, builders must understand FM's QIW enforcement
- **Mitigation**: Update both FM and all builders consistently

**QA Builder → All Builders**:
- QA Builder validates builder output; QIW affects what QA Builder checks
- **Mitigation**: Ensure QA Builder's QIW requirements align with builder expectations

**Governance Liaison → All Agents**:
- GL validates governance compliance; QIW is new governance requirement
- **Mitigation**: Ensure GL has clear QIW enforcement role

### 4.2 Workflow Dependencies

**GitHub Workflows**:
- Current: qa-enforcement.yml, minimum-build-to-red.yml, deprecation-detection.yml
- QIW: New watchdog channel, may require workflow integration
- **Risk**: QIW implementation may require new workflow (not in scope for this task)
- **Mitigation**: Document in agent contracts that QIW implementation is future work

### 4.3 Governance Memory Dependencies

**QIW Requirement**: Governance memory integration for quality incidents
- **Current State**: Memory system exists (evidence/learning logs)
- **Impact**: QIW incidents must be recordable
- **Risk**: Memory schema may need extension
- **Mitigation**: Document QIW memory requirements in agent contracts, defer implementation

---

## 5. Conflict Detection

### 5.1 Duplicate Bindings

**Check**: Is QIW already referenced in any agent contract?
- **Result**: NO - QIW is new canonical document (v1.0.0, effective 2026-01-13)
- **Conclusion**: No duplicate binding risk

### 5.2 Contradictions

**Check**: Does QIW contradict existing governance?
- **QIW Authority**: Subordinate to WATCHDOG_AUTHORITY_AND_SCOPE.md, BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md
- **QIW Alignment**: Enforces BUILD_PHILOSOPHY (zero-warning), extends WATCHDOG_AUTHORITY
- **Conclusion**: No contradictions - QIW is complementary to existing governance

### 5.3 Dependency Issues

**Check**: Are there dependencies that must be updated first?
- **QIW Dependencies**: WATCHDOG_AUTHORITY_AND_SCOPE.md (already referenced in governance repo)
- **Conclusion**: No blocking dependencies in PartPulse repository

## 6. Implementation Risks

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Self-modification violation | CATASTROPHIC | LOW | HALT | Strict exclusion of agent-contract-administrator.md |
| Inconsistent binding format | HIGH | LOW | Build break | Follow existing YAML structure exactly |
| Incomplete agent coverage | HIGH | MEDIUM | Governance gap | Update all 8 modifiable agents + .agent |
| QIW implementation confusion | MEDIUM | HIGH | Agent uncertainty | Clear "QIW implementation is future work" statement |
| Workflow integration assumption | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Expectation mismatch | Document that workflow changes are out of scope |
| Memory schema assumption | LOW | LOW | Future friction | Document memory integration as requirement, not implementation |

### Critical Risks (HALT conditions)

**CATASTROPHIC**: Modifying .github/agents/agent-contract-administrator.md
- **Prevention**: Explicit exclusion in change plan
- **Detection**: Pre-commit verification
- **Response**: HALT and escalate to CS2

**HIGH**: Incomplete agent coverage
- **Prevention**: Systematic review of all 9 agents
- **Detection**: Post-implementation audit
- **Response**: Complete missing updates before handover

## 7. Mitigation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Phased Implementation
1. ✅ Update .agent file first (repository-wide binding)
2. ✅ Update high-impact agents (FM, GL, QA)
3. ✅ Update medium-impact agents (builders)
4. ✅ Update low-impact agent (CodexAdvisor)
5. ✅ Verify all 8 agents updated (NOT including self)

### Strategy 2: Consistent Binding Format
- Use existing governance.bindings YAML structure
- Position QIW after AUTOMATED_DEPRECATION_DETECTION_GATE
- Follow established pattern: id, path, role, tier (if applicable), enforcement (if applicable)

### Strategy 3: Clear Implementation Boundaries
- QIW binding: ✅ In scope (governance reference)
- QIW operational awareness: ✅ In scope (agent requirements)
- QIW workflow implementation: ❌ Out of scope (future work)
- QIW memory schema: ❌ Out of scope (future work)
- QIW dashboard: ❌ Out of scope (future work)

### Strategy 4: Self-Modification Prevention
- ✅ Explicit exclusion of agent-contract-administrator.md
- ✅ Document self-awareness gap: "I need QIW but cannot add it to my own contract"
- ✅ Create improvement instruction for CS2 to update my contract

---

- ✅ Verify YAML syntax valid
- ✅ Verify no duplicate bindings

### Handover Checks
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ No test debt introduced
- ✅ No build warnings
- ✅ Evidence of systematic review

## 9. Risk Assessment Conclusion

**Overall Risk Level**: MEDIUM (manageable with mitigations)

**Proceed with Implementation**: ✅ YES

**Required Mitigations**:
1. ✅ Strict self-modification exclusion
2. ✅ Systematic agent coverage (8 of 9)
3. ✅ Consistent binding format
4. ✅ Clear implementation boundaries
5. ✅ Post-implementation verification

**Escalation Required**: NO (task authorized under existing governance)

---

## 10. Self-Awareness Gap Identified

**Issue**: This agent (agent-contract-administrator) requires QIW binding but cannot modify its own contract.

**Root Cause**: Constitutional self-modification prohibition (AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md)

**Impact**: My contract will lack QIW binding after this task, creating governance incompleteness.

**Resolution**: Create improvement instruction for CS2 after task completion.

**Instruction Content**:
- Title: "Add QIW Binding to Agent Contract Administrator"
- Gap: Missing WATCHDOG_QUALITY_INTEGRITY_CHANNEL.md binding
- Fix: Add QIW binding to governance.bindings section
- Justification: Constitutional self-modification prohibition prevents self-update
