# Risk Assessment: Agent Contract Protocol Alignment
**Date**: 2026-01-13T10:17:07Z  
**Agent**: Agent Contract Administrator  
**Assessment ID**: RISK-001  
**Purpose**: Evaluate risks of aligning all agent contracts with AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md

---

## Change Overview

**Change Type**: Constitutional governance alignment  
**Scope**: All 9 agent contract files in `.github/agents/`  
**Authority**: Tier-0 AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md v1.0.0  
**Trigger**: Issue directive to align with canonical protocol

---

## Risk Categories

### 1. Operational Risk: LOW

**Assessment**: Agent contracts will have ADDITIONAL constraints, not REMOVED constraints.

**Rationale**:
- Changes ADD self-edit prohibitions (defensive)
- Changes ADD governance bindings (clarifying)
- Changes ADD instruction system documentation (procedural)
- NO removal of existing capabilities
- NO weakening of existing prohibitions

**Mitigation**: None required - changes are restrictive/clarifying only.

---

### 2. Compliance Risk: MEDIUM → LOW (after alignment)

**Current State**: MEDIUM  
- 7/9 agents lack explicit AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md binding
- 9/9 agents lack explicit self-edit prohibition section
- Potential for inadvertent self-modification attempts

**Post-Alignment**: LOW  
- All agents will have constitutional self-edit prohibition
- All agents will bind to contract management protocol
- Clear instruction system documented

**Mitigation**: Execute alignment as planned.

---

### 3. Implementation Risk: LOW

**Assessment**: Changes are additive and formulaic.

**Rationale**:
- Clear template pattern from canonical protocol
- No complex logic changes required
- No code execution path changes
- Changes are documentation-only

**Mitigation**: 
- Use consistent template for all agents
- Validate each contract after modification
- Review for naming consistency

---

### 4. Ripple Risk: LOW

**Assessment**: Changes are internal to agent contracts, minimal cross-agent impact.

**Affected Systems**:
- ✅ Agent contracts themselves (primary change)
- ⚠️  Agent behavior (strengthened prohibitions)
- ✅ Governance enforcement (improved clarity)
- ✅ Repository `.agent` file (already compliant, no changes needed)

**No Impact On**:
- Application code
- Test suites
- CI/CD workflows
- Database schema
- External integrations

**Mitigation**: None required - ripples are positive and contained.

---

### 5. Self-Modification Risk: SPECIAL CONSIDERATION

**Context**: I (agent-contract-administrator) am modifying agent contracts, including my own.

**Analysis per AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md Section 4.4**:

> "Cross-Agent Modifications: An agent MAY modify another agent's contract IF:
> - The modifying agent has explicit authority (e.g., Governance Liaison)
> - The modification is part of a governance ripple or layerdown
> - The modification is approved via the instruction system
> - The modification is documented with ripple awareness"

**My Authority**:
- ✅ I am "sole authority for writing and modifying `.agent` files" (my contract line 20)
- ✅ This is a governance ripple (Tier-0 protocol alignment)
- ✅ Approved via issue directive (implicit approval from governance)
- ✅ Documented with scan and risk assessment

**Self-Modification Specific**:
- ⚠️  I am modifying `agent-contract-administrator.md` (my own contract)
- ⚠️  This appears to violate Section 4.2: "Agents are PROHIBITED from writing to their own contract files"

**Resolution**:
- ❌ I MUST NOT modify my own contract
- ✅ I WILL modify all OTHER agent contracts
- ⚠️  I MUST escalate my own contract modification via instruction system

**Action Required**:
1. Modify 8 other agent contracts (ForemanApp, governance-liaison, builders, CodexAdvisor)
2. Create instruction for modifying agent-contract-administrator.md
3. Escalate to human governance (Johan Ras) or FM

## Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Current | Post-Change | Trend |
|--------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Operational | LOW | LOW | → |
| Compliance | MEDIUM | LOW | ↓ |
| Implementation | LOW | LOW | → |
| Ripple | LOW | LOW | → |
| Self-Modification | N/A | SPECIAL | ⚠️ |

**Overall Risk Level**: LOW (with self-modification escalation required)

---

## Approval Decision

**Recommended Action**: PROCEED with modifications to 8 agent contracts, ESCALATE self-contract modification

**Conditions**:
1. ✅ Modify all agent contracts EXCEPT agent-contract-administrator.md
2. ⚠️  Create instruction document for agent-contract-administrator.md
3. ✅ Document all changes in audit evidence
4. ✅ Validate naming consistency
5. ✅ Verify constitutional language is used

---

## Escalation Path

**For agent-contract-administrator.md modification**:

1. Create instruction document in `governance/agent-contract-instructions/pending/`
2. Reference this risk assessment
3. Reference canonical protocol requirement
4. Request human governance or FM approval
5. Wait for external modification

**Alternative**: Request FM or governance-liaison to modify agent-contract-administrator.md as part of this governance ripple.

---

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1 (Self-Executable)**:
- [ ] 8 agent contracts updated with protocol binding
- [ ] 8 agent contracts have self-edit prohibition section
- [ ] 8 agent contracts document instruction system
- [ ] Naming consistency verified
- [ ] Audit evidence created

**Phase 2 (Requires Escalation)**:
- [ ] Instruction created for agent-contract-administrator.md
- [ ] Escalation to appropriate authority
- [ ] External modification of agent-contract-administrator.md
- [ ] Final validation

---

## Timeline

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Phase 1**: 1.5 hours (8 contracts)  
**Phase 2**: 0.5 hours (instruction creation + escalation)  
**Validation**: 0.5 hours

---

**Risk Assessment Complete**  
**Decision**: APPROVED with self-modification escalation  
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 modifications
