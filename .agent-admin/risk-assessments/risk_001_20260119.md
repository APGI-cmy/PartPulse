# Risk Assessment: Agent Contract Binding Remediation
**Date**: 2026-01-19 13:52:00 UTC  
**Agent**: agent-contract-administrator v3.0.0  
**Repository**: APGI-cmy/PartPulse  
**Assessment ID**: risk_001_20260119

---

## Context

**Initiative**: Systematic Governance Remediation Phase 6  
**Scope**: Update 7 agent contracts with complete canonical binding sets  
**Authority**: Issue #[TBD], PR APGI-cmy/PartPulse#975, BL-027/BL-028, CS2

---

## Risk Categories

### 1. Binding Completeness Risk

**Risk**: Incomplete or incorrect binding propagation to agent contracts  
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Severity**: HIGH

**Detailed Analysis**:
- 10 universal bindings must be added to 7 agent contracts (70 binding additions)
- Agent-specific bindings (4 liaison, 7 FM, 3 builder × 5 = 15) add 26 more bindings (96 total)
- Manual transcription errors could occur
- YAML syntax errors could break contract parsing
- Missing or incorrect canonical paths could render bindings ineffective

**Mitigation**:
- Use agent-contract-administrator.md v3.0.0 as reference template (proven correct)
- Copy-paste binding YAML blocks to minimize transcription errors
- Run yamllint after each contract update (BL-028 compliance)
- Verify canonical paths exist in governance repo references
- Cross-check each agent's final binding count against requirements

**Residual Risk**: LOW (with disciplined execution)

---

### 2. Gate Validation Failure Risk

**Risk**: Pre-gate validation failures block PR merge  
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Severity**: HIGH

**Detailed Analysis**:
- BL-027: SCOPE_DECLARATION.md must be created and validated
- BL-028: yamllint warnings ARE errors (not stylistic, must fix all)
- validate-scope-to-diff.sh must exit with code 0
- Previous ecosystem failure was caused by skipping these validations
- "Manual verification" is prohibited - must run actual scripts

**Mitigation**:
- Create SCOPE_DECLARATION.md immediately before final validation
- Run validate-scope-to-diff.sh locally and document exit code
- Run yamllint .github/agents/*.md and fix ALL warnings before handover
- Document all gate execution commands and exit codes in PREHANDOVER_PROOF
- HALT if any gate fails, fix completely, re-run until exit code 0

**Residual Risk**: LOW (with guaranteed gate success protocol)

---

### 3. Version Synchronization Risk

**Risk**: Contract version numbers or version history sections become inconsistent  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Detailed Analysis**:
- 7 agents have different current versions (v2.3.0, v4.2.0, v3.2.0, etc.)
- Version bump strategy must be consistent (likely minor version bump for all)
- Version history entries must accurately reflect binding additions
- Metadata version fields must match markdown version declarations

**Mitigation**:
- Increment minor version for each agent (e.g., v2.3.0 → v2.4.0, v4.2.0 → v4.3.0)
- Add standardized version history entry referencing this remediation
- Cross-check YAML metadata.version against markdown version sections
- Document version changes in completion report

**Residual Risk**: LOW

---

### 4. Contract-Specific Content Risk

**Risk**: Overwriting or losing agent-specific content during binding addition  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Detailed Analysis**:
- Each agent has unique mission, scope, constraints, operational protocols
- Binding additions should be surgical (YAML frontmatter only)
- Risk of accidentally removing or altering agent-specific sections
- Different agents have different structures (minimal vs. detailed contracts)

**Mitigation**:
- Only modify governance.bindings section in YAML frontmatter
- Preserve all existing content unless explicitly incorrect
- Use view + edit tools (not create/overwrite)
- Review git diff after each change to verify surgical modification
- If agent-specific sections reference old bindings, update references minimally

**Residual Risk**: LOW

---

### 5. Test Debt Accumulation Risk

**Risk**: Changes introduce test failures or create test debt  
**Likelihood**: VERY LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH (constitutional violation)  
**Severity**: LOW

**Detailed Analysis**:
- Agent contract changes are metadata/documentation only
- No executable code changes
- Unlikely to cause test failures
- However, contract validation scripts might exist

**Mitigation**:
- Verify no breaking changes to contract schemas
- Run any contract validation tests if they exist
- Check for broken links to canonical governance documents
- Zero Test Debt doctrine applies even to documentation changes

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW

---

### 6. Cross-Repository Consistency Risk

**Risk**: PartPulse contracts diverge from governance-repo canonical bindings  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Detailed Analysis**:
- Bindings reference external canonical governance repo
- Canonical documents may have moved, renamed, or versioned
- Agent contracts must reference current canonical locations
- Governance ripple model requires alignment

**Mitigation**:
- Verify canonical paths match governance repo structure
- Use repository: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance consistently
- Reference main branch (or specify commit SHA if pinning)
- Document any canonical path uncertainties for escalation

**Residual Risk**: LOW

---

### 7. Improvement Capture Omission Risk

**Risk**: Failing to complete mandatory enhancement capture post-job  
**Likelihood**: VERY LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (governance violation)  
**Severity**: LOW

**Detailed Analysis**:
- MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_STANDARD.md v2.0.0 requires both:
  1. Feature Enhancement Review (proposal OR explicit "none identified")
  2. Process Improvement Reflection (ALL 5 questions answered)
- This is "the BASIS of the entire system" - not optional
- Omission would be governance violation

**Mitigation**:
- Schedule improvement capture as final handover step
- Use completion report template that enforces both sections
- Mark all proposals as "PARKED — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION"
- Route to `.architecture/parking-station/` or `governance/agent-contract-instructions/pending/`

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW (with checklist enforcement)

## Risk Matrix Summary

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Residual Risk |
|---------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Binding Completeness | MEDIUM | HIGH | HIGH | LOW |
| Gate Validation Failure | MEDIUM | HIGH | HIGH | LOW |
| Version Synchronization | LOW | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | LOW |
| Contract-Specific Content | LOW | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW |
| Test Debt Accumulation | VERY LOW | HIGH | LOW | VERY LOW |
| Cross-Repo Consistency | LOW | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | LOW |
| Improvement Capture Omission | VERY LOW | MEDIUM | LOW | VERY LOW |

**Overall Risk Level**: MEDIUM → LOW (with mitigations)

---

## Special Focus Areas

1. **Binding Completeness** - Use reference contract as template, verify counts
2. **Gate Validation** - Guaranteed success required (not hope), document exit codes
3. **BL-027/BL-028 Compliance** - SCOPE_DECLARATION.md + yamllint exit code 0 mandatory

---

## Escalation Triggers

- Any gate fails after multiple fix attempts → CS2
- Canonical governance paths cannot be verified → CS2
- Contract schema validation fails → CS2
- YAML syntax errors persist after fixing → CS2
- Any blocker preventing 100% completion → CS2

## Risk Assessment Approval

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED FOR EXECUTION  
**Condition**: With documented mitigations applied  
**Next Step**: Implementation (governance-first change management)
