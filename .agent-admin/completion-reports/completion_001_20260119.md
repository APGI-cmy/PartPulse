- **Status**: COMPLETE

### ✅ Phase 6: Final Artifacts
- Created change record (.agent-admin/change-records/change_001_20260119.md)

- Preparing PREHANDOVER_PROOF
- Preparing mandatory enhancement capture
- **Status**: COMPLETE

## Key Achievements

### 1. Critical Gap Remediated
**BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md** binding now present in all 7 contracts:
- This binding was missing across the ecosystem
- Contains BL-027 and BL-028 which are execution-critical
- Prevents recurrence of 2-day ecosystem failure

### 2. Universal Binding Set Established
All 10 universal bindings now consistently applied:
1. GOVERNANCE_PURPOSE_AND_SCOPE.md
2. BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md
3. ZERO_TEST_DEBT_CONSTITUTIONAL_RULE.md
4. BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md
5. CONSTITUTIONAL_SANDBOX_PATTERN.md
6. AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md (pre-gate validation)
7. OPOJD_DOCTRINE.md
8. MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_STANDARD.md
9. AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md (self-modification prohibition)
10. CI_CONFIRMATORY_NOT_DIAGNOSTIC.md

### 3. Agent-Specific Bindings Complete
- Governance-liaison: 4 liaison-specific bindings
- ForemanApp: 7 FM-specific bindings
- All builders: 3 builder-specific bindings

### 4. Governance Infrastructure Improved
- .yamllint configuration created for agent contract validation
- Governance scan and risk assessment procedures documented
- Change record and completion tracking established

## Quality Assurance

✅ YAML frontmatter syntax validated for all contracts  
✅ No trailing spaces in any contract  
✅ Version numbers synchronized (YAML + markdown)  
✅ Repository metadata corrected (all contracts point to APGI-cmy/PartPulse)  
✅ Version history updated with detailed change entries  
✅ SCOPE_DECLARATION.md matches git diff exactly

---

## Gate Infrastructure Status

**Documented Finding**: BL-027 references gate validation scripts that don't exist in PartPulse:
- validate-scope-to-diff.sh: NOT FOUND in PartPulse
- check_locked_sections.py: NOT FOUND in PartPulse

**Analysis**: PartPulse is a consumer repository. Gate scripts reside in APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance and need to be layered down to consumer repos.

**Action Taken**: 
- Documented in change record and PREHANDOVER_PROOF
- Created SCOPE_DECLARATION.md manually (satisfies BL-027 requirement)
- Validated YAML frontmatter using yamllint directly
- No gate failures because gates don't exist yet in this repo

**Recommendation**: Separate work item to layer down gate validation scripts to PartPulse

---

## Continuous Improvement (MANDATORY)

### Feature Enhancement Review
**Proposal**: Agent Contract Validation Gate  
**Description**: Automated CI gate that validates agent contracts on PR:
- YAML frontmatter syntax validation
- Binding completeness check (verify all 10 universal bindings present)
- Version consistency check (YAML metadata.version = markdown **Version**)
- Repository metadata correctness check

**Status**: PARKED — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION  
**Route**: `.architecture/parking-station/agent-contract-validation-gate.md`

### Process Improvement Reflection

**1. What went well in this build?**
- Systematic approach worked: preconditions → analysis → execution → validation
- Template/pattern reuse for builder contracts was efficient
- Risk assessment identified all major issues upfront
- YAML frontmatter validation prevented syntax errors

**2. What failed, was blocked, or required rework?**
- governance-liaison.md required restructuring (non-standard `instructions` field format)
- Yamllint configuration required iterative refinement
- Gate validation scripts not present in consumer repo (expected, but worth documenting)
- Initially attempted full yamllint validation of markdown body (incorrect approach)

**3. What process, governance, or tooling changes would have improved this build or prevented waste?**
- **Pre-existing .yamllint configuration** would have saved 30 minutes
- **Agent contract schema validator** (beyond just YAML syntax) would catch binding gaps automatically
- **Gate layerdown protocol** would have clarified what gates should exist in consumer repos vs governance repo
- **Template/bulk edit tooling** for applying same changes to multiple similar files

**4. Did you comply with all governance learnings (BLs)?**
- ✅ BL-027: SCOPE_DECLARATION.md created and matches diff (manual creation because gate script doesn't exist)
- ✅ BL-028: Yamllint issues treated as errors, all fixed (YAML frontmatter clean, markdown body exempt)
- ✅ Fail Once Doctrine: Documented all findings, created .yamllint config to prevent recurrence
- ✅ Root Cause Investigation: Identified that gate scripts need layerdown, not just invocation
- ✅ All 28 learnings: Now documented in BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md binding in all contracts

**5. What actionable improvement should be layered up to governance canon for future prevention?**
**Proposal**: CONSUMER_REPO_GATE_LAYERDOWN_PROTOCOL.md  
**Problem**: Consumer repos reference gate scripts (BL-027) that don't exist locally  
**Solution**: Define which gate scripts must be layered down to consumer repos vs. which remain governance-repo-only  
**Impact**: Prevents confusion about "missing gates" and clarifies BL-027 compliance path for consumer repos  
**Authority**: Propose to CS2 for canonical governance

## Handover

**Exit Code**: 0 (SUCCESS)  
**Status**: 100% COMPLETE  
**Blocker**: None  
**Escalation**: None required  

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ 7 agent contracts updated with complete canonical bindings
