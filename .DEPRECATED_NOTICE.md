# DEPRECATED DOCUMENTS NOTICE

The following documents in this repository were created based on an **incorrect understanding of agent authority boundaries** and are now **DEPRECATED**:

## Deprecated Documents

1. **`GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_V5_AWAITING_APPROVAL.md`**
   - Status: DEPRECATED
   - Reason: Proposed cross-repository operations (Options A, B, C)
   - Date Deprecated: 2026-02-08
   - Replaced By: `GOVERNANCE_CANONICAL_STATUS_V5.md` + `GOVERNANCE_CS2_ISSUE_TEMPLATES.md`

2. **`.agent-admin/proposals/governance-ripple-v5.0.0-layerdown.md`**
   - Status: DEPRECATED
   - Reason: Cross-repository layer-down plan violating authority boundaries
   - Date Deprecated: 2026-02-08
   - Replaced By: `GOVERNANCE_CS2_ISSUE_TEMPLATES.md`

3. **`.agent-admin/proposals/governance-ripple-v5.0.0-manual-execution-guide.md`**
   - Status: DEPRECATED
   - Reason: Manual cross-repo execution guide
   - Date Deprecated: 2026-02-08
   - Replaced By: CS2 creates issues in target repos directly

## Why These Documents Are Deprecated

**Incorrect Model**: These documents assumed PartPulse agents should coordinate cross-repository operations.

**Correct Model**: Agents work ONLY within their own repository. CS2 coordinates cross-repo governance by creating issues in target repositories.

## Realignment Authority

**Date**: 2026-02-08T08:32:00Z  
**Authority**: CS2 (Johan)  
**Reference**: `GOVERNANCE_REALIGNMENT_AGENT_AUTHORITY.md`

## Use Correct Documents Instead

For governance ripple coordination, use:
- **`GOVERNANCE_CANONICAL_STATUS_V5.md`** - PartPulse canonical status
- **`GOVERNANCE_CS2_ISSUE_TEMPLATES.md`** - Issue templates for CS2
- **`GOVERNANCE_REALIGNMENT_AGENT_AUTHORITY.md`** - Complete realignment explanation
